dish
====

miniature in-memory http static middleware optimized for serving buffers or strings

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/carlos8f/node-dish.png)](http://travis-ci.org/carlos8f/node-dish)

Given a file path, string or buffer, **dish** will create you an HTTP server request
listener, with added benefits:

- gzip support
- ETag / Conditional GET support
- In-memory cache (faster than accessing the disk for every request)
- HTTP keep-alive timeout

Install
-------

```
$ npm install --save dish
```

Basic usage
-----------

To serve a raw string or buffer:

```js
var dish = require('dish')
  , server = require('http').createServer()

server.on('request', dish('hello world!')); // can also accept a Buffer instance
server.listen(3000);
```

To serve a file (mime-type autodetected from file name)

```js
server.on('request', dish.file('./facepalm.jpg'));
```

Options
-------

You can pass options as the second parameter to `dish()`.

- `headers` (Object) - override / specify headers to send. Be sure to set a `Content-Type`
  header if you are serving a string or buffer.
- `keepAlive` (Number) - HTTP keep-alive timeout in milliseconds. Use this to
  cut down on excess persistent connections to your server.
- `maxAge` (Number) - Proxy cache lifetime in seconds. Use this if you are using
  a reverse proxy such as Varnish.
- `gzip` (Boolean) - Set to `false` to disable gzip in responses.

### Status code

You can control the status code of the response by passing a Number as the third
argument of the request handler:

```js
var handler = dish('page not found');
server.on('request', function (req, res) {
  if (req.url === '/nonsense') {
    handler(req, res, 404); // Status code will be 404
  }
});
```

Example as middleware
---------------------

```js
var dish = require('dish')
  , middler = require('middler')
  , server = require('http').createServer()

middler(server)
  // a simple "about us" page
  .get('/about', dish.file('./about.html'))
  // Serve a dynamic javascript file with gzip support:
  .get('/my-code.js', function (req, res, next) {
    // create some dynamic javascript...
    var myCode = 'var myNumber = ' + Math.random();
    // serve it
    dish(myCode, {headers: {'Content-Type': 'text/javascript'}})(req, res);
  });

server.listen(3000);
```
